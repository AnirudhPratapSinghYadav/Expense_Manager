# Expense_Manager
This is my first project, developed entirely using Python. For the frontend, I utilized Tkinter, and for the background design, I used Canva. The project addresses a common issue faced by college hostellers: managing their pocket money. Many students receive a fixed amount of money each month, but before the month ends, they often struggle to track their expenses, leading to overspending. This tool aims to help students track their expenditures, providing them with an overview of their spending habits and helping them manage their finances more effectively.  While this is just a starting point, there are several areas where the project can be enhanced in the future. For instance, integrating features such as direct interfaces with UPI payments or bank transactions can automate the process of expense tracking. This would make the application even more efficient and user-friendly. I am excited to continue developing this project in the coming years and improve it with more advanced features.
